                <b1>This project aims to create an equitable and permeable residential and commercial environment, expressed in the form of a set of interconnected housing units resembling small'villages'. Implemented in the Serengeti region, the project's conception was approached from different angles to execute volumes and voids that address the climatic, economic, and social aspects of the environment.</b1>

                <b1>The project was designed in modules containing 9 to 12 houses, forming the villages, arranged to create a space with good pedestrian flow, pleasant ventilation and sunlight, a coherent aesthetic, and a viable structure. The dwellings within these modules, inspired by typical residences in the landscape, are arranged in a circular format and have a centrality on the ground level. This central area features a semi-private communal space containing various public facilities, such as water tanks, water pumps, and cooking spaces, along with vegetation. This creates small spaces that divide the terrain into different levels of privacy.</b1>
