                <b1>The structure features an immersive space at its front, with gardens surrounded by benches of varying dimensions over a concrete floor. These elements create a transition between the bustling environment of Rua Augusta and the tranquility of the gallery. The interior space is also divided between the reception area (contained in the smaller initial volume) and the gallery itself, providing a clear separation between being in the outside and being within the space. Additionally, a large garden surrounded by wooden benches is designed at the rear of the property. Finally, the inclinations and heights of the project's volumes are defined by the heights of the surrounding buildings.</b1>
